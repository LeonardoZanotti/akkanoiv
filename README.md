Game Akkanoiv

Some explication about the files:

In the akkanoiv folder has the Akkanoiv.exe file (the executable game to play) and the Assets folder, in this folder we has:
The Sprites folder, for the images of the game.
The Scripts folder has the codes about the ball, the player, the blocks and the game control.
The Scene folder, it has the Unity file of the scene of the game.

I dont make a Start Menu neither a Game Over menu, sorry for that.
